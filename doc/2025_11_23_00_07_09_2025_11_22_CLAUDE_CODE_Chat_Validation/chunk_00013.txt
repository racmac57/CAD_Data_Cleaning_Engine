  The validation script is ready to run on your full 700K+ record master file whenever you're ready! > Apply updated FullAddress2 corrections to the latest CAD file:

📂 Input File:
- `/test/2025_11_17_CAD_With_RMS.csv`

📁 Updated Correction Rules:
- `C:\\Users\\carucci_r\\OneDrive - City of
Hackensack\\02_ETL_Scripts\\CAD_Data_Cleaning_Engine\\test\\updates_corrections_FullAddress2.csv`

🧠 Fix Logic:
1. Match on `FullAddress2`
2. If a match exists in the correction file:
   - Replace with the corrected value
3. If no match exists:
   - Leave the address unchanged

⚠️ Special Notes:
- For records like `Main Street & , Hackensack, NJ, 07601`, no fix should be applied unless a valid cross street is
known. - These are major streets without a second intersecting road; treat them as **incomplete intersections**, not
errors. - Log them as `UNFIXED_CONTEXTUAL_REQUIRED`

📤 Output:
- `/test/2025_11_17_CAD_FullAddress2_AutoFixed.csv`

📊 Log Report:
- `/test/FullAddress2_AutoFix_Log.csv`
  - Columns: `ReportNumberNew`, `Original_Address`, `New_Address`, `Fix_Applied`, `Issue_Type`
  - Categories: `FIXED`, `NO_MATCH`, `UNFIXED_CONTEXTUAL_REQUIRED`

---

### 📚 Update Documentation:
Also update `@doc/MANUAL_EDITING_STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`:
- Add the new auto-fixed file path
- Note that ~7–10% of incomplete intersections (e.g. "Main Street &") remain due to lack of a second cross street

● ✅ FullAddress2 Auto-Corrections Applied Successfully

  I've successfully applied the FullAddress2 corrections to your CAD data. Here's the comprehensive summary:

  ---
  📊 Correction Results

  Dataset: /test/2025_11_17_CAD_With_RMS.csv (3,770 records)
  Correction Rules: 119 rules from /test/updates_corrections_FullAddress2.csv

  Breakdown:
  - ✅ FIXED: 145 records (3.8%)
  - ℹ️ NO_MATCH: 3,615 records (95.9%) - No correction rule found
  - ⚠️ UNFIXED_CONTEXTUAL_REQUIRED: 10 records (0.3%)

  ---
  🎯 Top Auto-Corrections Applied

  1. Generic Park Locations → Specific Addresses
  - "Carver Park & ," → "[ADDRESS-REDACTED], Hackensack, NJ 07601"
  - "Johnson Park & ," → "[ADDRESS-REDACTED], Hackensack, NJ 07601"

  2. Route Number Standardization
  - "139 Route 17 South" → "139 NJ-17, Hackensack, NJ 07601"

  3. Midtown Bridge Corrections
  - "85 Midtown Bridge Approach" → "85 Midtown Bridge Street"

  ---
  ⚠️ Unfixed Incomplete Intersections (0.3%)

  9 unique addresses flagged as UNFIXED_CONTEXTUAL_REQUIRED:

  1. "Euclid Avenue & ," (2 occurrences)
  2. "South State Street & ,"
  3. "Park Street & ,"
  4. "Main Street & ,"
  5. "Union Street & ,"
  6. "Hackensack Avenue & ,"
  7. "Anderson Street & ,"
  8. "Maple Avenue & ,"
  9. "Essex Street & ,"

  Why Unfixed? These are major streets without a second intersecting road in the correction rules. They require contextual
  information (CAD notes review, officer knowledge, or GIS lookup) to determine the correct cross street. Note: In the full 700K+ dataset, this pattern may represent 7-10% of incomplete intersection records. ---

### 📊 Section 1: Baseline Audit Summary

Summarize the quality of the sample data BEFORE any data cleanup or mapping:
- % of blank or malformed fields for:
  - `Incident`
  - `FullAddress2`
  - `Time of Call`
  - `Disposition`
  - `ReportNumberNew`
  - `Officer`

Also include a CSV summary:
- Path: `data/02_reports/cad_validation/CAD_Baseline_Quality_Report.csv`

---

### ❗ Section 2: Top 10 Most Common Issues

Create a list of top data quality problems from the sample, including:
- "Main Street & , Hackensack" → missing cross street
- Generic or unmapped incidents like "Targeted Area Patrol"
- Burglary incidents using outdated classification (pre-enhanced)
- Invalid or malformed case numbers (e.g., missing dash, wrong year)

Include a frequency count and percentage if possible. ---

### 📌 Section 3: Recommendations

Write a bullet-point summary of what this shows the admin team:
- How much the data quality has improved after mapping and backfill
- Where the worst issues were concentrated (e.g., addresses, legacy incidents)
- Remaining gaps (e.g., missing `PDZone`, `Grid`, use of generic incident labels)
- Recommend rerunning quality scoring periodically to monitor drift

---

### 🔍 Section 4: Follow-up Checks

Also include:
- Was `classify_burglary_ollama.py` used? → ❌ No
- Is it needed? → Possibly yes, to resolve legacy burglary classifications like `2C:18-2`
- Recommend integrating this script or flagging unmapped `Incident` codes starting with `2C:` if a mapping is
unavailable

  | ✅ Time of Call    | 100.0%        | 0.0%       |
  | ⚠️ Disposition    | 92.7%         | 7.3%       |
  | ✅ ReportNumberNew | 100.0%        | 0.0%       |
  | ✅ Officer         | 100.0%        | 0.0%       |

  Key Findings:
  - Best Field: Incident, FullAddress2, Time of Call, ReportNumberNew, Officer (0% blank)
  - Worst Field: Disposition (7.3% blank)
  - Overall Quality: 98.8% across all fields

  ❗ Section 2: Top 5 Data Quality Issues

  1. 🟡 Blank Disposition (MEDIUM)
  - 73 records (7.3%)
  - Records without case disposition

  2. 🟢 Missing Grid (LOW)
  - 71 records (7.1%)
  - Records without grid assignment

  3. 🟡 Missing PDZone (MEDIUM)
  - 71 records (7.1%)
  - Records without police district zone

  4. 🟠 Incomplete Intersections (HIGH)
  - 10 records (1.0%)
  - Example: "Canceled Call & , Hackensack, NJ, 07601"
  - Missing cross street in intersection format

  5. 🟡 Generic TAPS Incidents (MEDIUM)
  - 4 records (0.4%)
  - Using "Targeted Area Patrol" instead of enhanced TAPS-ESU types

  Total Impact: 229 records (22.9%) have at least one quality issue

  📌 Section 3: Key Recommendations

  ✅ Data Quality Improvements After Cleanup
  - Estimated 23% improvement possible with cleanup pipeline
  - Focus on HIGH and CRITICAL issues first

  🎯 Where Issues Are Concentrated:

  1. Address Data Quality
    - 10 incomplete intersections need cross streets
    - Apply FullAddress2 correction rules and RMS backfill
  2. Incident Classification Drift
    - 4 generic TAPS incidents need enhancement
    - No legacy burglary classifications found (good!) - Use incident type mapping for proper classification
  3. Missing Metadata Fields
    - 71 records missing PDZone/Grid (7.1%)
    - Backfill from RMS or GIS lookup based on address

  🔄 Ongoing Monitoring:
  - ✅ Rerun audit monthly to monitor drift
  - ✅ Track quality score trends (target: >95%)
  - ✅ Set up automated alerts when critical fields exceed 10% blank rate
  - ✅ Compare 2019 vs 2024+ data to identify classification drift

  🔍 Section 4: Follow-up Checks

  Burglary Classification Tool:
  - ❌ classify_burglary_ollama.py was NOT used (this is raw data)
  - ✅ No legacy burglary classifications found in 2024 sample
  - ⚠️ May still need to check older data (2019-2023)

  TAPS/ESU Enhancement:
  - 4 records use generic "Targeted Area Patrol"
  - Should be enhanced to specific types:
    - TAPS - Business
    - TAPS - ESU - Business
    - TAPS - ESU - Medical Facility
    - TAPS - ESU - Park
    - TAPS - ESU - Parking Garage
    - TAPS - ESU - Religious Facility
    - TAPS - ESU - School
    - TAPS - Housing

  Incident Code Validation:
  - Flag any incident starting with 2C: for validation
  - Create exception list for codes that don't map cleanly
  - Escalate to admin team for manual classification

  📈 Next Steps

  1. Apply Data Cleanup Pipeline
    - Run incident type mapping
    - Apply FullAddress2 corrections
    - Backfill missing fields from RMS
  2. Re-run Quality Audit
    - Compare before/after metrics
    - Validate cleanup addressed major issues
  3. Establish Quality Baselines
    - Set target thresholds (e.g., <2% blank rate)
    - Create dashboard for ongoing monitoring
  4. Address Remaining Gaps
    - Manual review of unfixable issues
    - Document exceptions and edge cases

  🎯 Key Insights

  Good News:
  - ✅ 98.8% overall quality - Raw data is already quite good! - ✅ No legacy burglary classifications in 2024 data
  - ✅ All critical fields (Incident, Address, Time, Case#, Officer) are 100% populated

  Areas for Improvement:
  - ⚠️ 7.3% missing Disposition (73 records)
  - ⚠️ 7.1% missing PDZone/Grid (71 records)
  - ⚠️ 1.0% incomplete intersections (10 records)
  - ⚠️ 0.4% generic TAPS (4 records)

  Estimated Improvement Potential: 23% of records can be enhanced through cleanup
