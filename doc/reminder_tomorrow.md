## Reminder for Tomorrow

- Revisit the Git remote alignment between the local `main` branch (CAD_Data_Pipeline code) and the remote repository `racmac57/CAD_Standardization`.
- Decide whether to:
  - Create a new remote for CAD_Data_Pipeline, or
  - Realign histories by merging/migrating files into `CAD_Standardization`.
- Once the strategy is chosen, run the appropriate `git pull`/`git push` sequence and confirm the docs commit (`69e010c`) lands upstream.

_Created automatically so it’s top-of-mind when you’re back in the office tomorrow._
