### 2. Complete file path structure (important)
Missing complete directory structure and file naming conventions for all relevant files. ### 3. Integration with other correction types (important)
Doesn't explain how address corrections interact with disposition, case number, and how_reported corrections, or the order of application. ### 4. Geocoding script configuration (important)
Missing specific configuration details for the ArcGIS locator and validation requirements. ### 5. Testing strategy (important)
No specific testing approach before processing 700K records. ### 6. Rollback procedures (important)
Missing how to rollback if something goes wrong. ## Additional enhancements needed

7. Data type preservation — ensure types aren't corrupted
8. Encoding requirements — UTF-8 with BOM for ESRI
9. Natural vs merge duplicates detection — algorithm to distinguish them
10. Progress reporting — real-time updates for long operations
11. Verification sample size — how many records to verify manually
12. Performance benchmarks — expected timing metrics

## Document created

Location: `data/02_reports/PROMPT_REVIEW_AND_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

The document includes:
- Detailed analysis of each missing element
- Code examples for fixes
- Specific file paths and line numbers
- Recommended prompt structure updates
- Priority levels (Critical/Important/Nice to Have)

The most critical addition is the Hour field fix investigation, as it may be the source of the duplicate records. Should I create an enhanced version of the Claude Code prompt incorporating these findings? ---
