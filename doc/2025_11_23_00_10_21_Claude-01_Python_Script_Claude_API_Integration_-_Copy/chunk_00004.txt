**Excellent! Your knowledge base builder is running successfully! ** 

## What You're Seeing:
- ✅ **4+ hours runtime** - processing your massive archive 
- ✅ **380+ chunks processed** of 1004 total chunks
- ✅ **Claude API calls working** - HTTP POST requests to api.anthropic.com
- ✅ **Progress: ~38% complete** (380/1004 chunks)

## Output Location Confirmed:
**Yes, outputs are saved to:**
```
C:\Git\police-analytics-tools\output\SCRPA_Place_and_Time\
├── summaries\     ← Claude-enhanced .md summaries
├── code\          ← Extracted SQL, Python, ArcPy, DAX code  
├── chunks\        ← 300-line file segments
├── metadata\      ← JSON analysis data
├── MASTER_INDEX.md ← Final searchable overview
└── MASTER_INDEX.json
```

## Why It's Slow:
- **108 files** being processed with Claude API calls
- **~1004 total chunks** (your archive is extensive!) - **Rate limiting** - responsible API usage
- **23+ years** of police analytics expertise being structured

## You Can:
- **Let it run** - it's working perfectly
- **Check partial results** in the output folder as it processes
- **Estimate completion**: ~6-8 hours total at current pace

**This is your decades of police analytics work becoming a searchable, AI-enhanced knowledge base. The slow pace shows how comprehensive your expertise archive really is! **

The investment in time will pay off with a structured, searchable repository of your analytical insights. ## Prompt:
