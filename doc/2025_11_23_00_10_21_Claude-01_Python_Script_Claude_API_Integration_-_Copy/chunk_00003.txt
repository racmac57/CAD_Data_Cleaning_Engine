**$3.6 billion is definitely not correct** - that would be an absurd amount for API credits. ## This is Obviously a Bug:
• API credits typically cost $5-50 for normal usage
• Even heavy enterprise usage is hundreds/thousands, not billions
• The display is likely showing corrupted data

## What to Do:
**Don't purchase anything with that amount showing! **

1. **Refresh the page** - likely just a display glitch
2. **Check your actual usage** in the Anthropic console
3. **Contact Anthropic support** if the error persists
4. **Try a different browser** or clear cache

## For Your Knowledge Base Project:
Processing your 108 police analytics files should cost roughly:
- **Estimate: $10-30 total** for all your chat logs
- Each file summary costs pennies with Claude API
- Much more reasonable than $3.6 billion! ## Quick Fix:
Try refreshing the billing page or logging out/back in. This is clearly a frontend display bug, not your actual charges. **Don't worry - your police analytics knowledge base project won't cost billions! ** Let me know what the page shows after refreshing. ## Prompt:
