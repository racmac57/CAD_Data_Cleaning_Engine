Previous session accomplished: Built complete Git-based kb_builder system, processed all 216 files with heuristic analysis (FREE), tested Claude API on 3 samples ($3-4 showing professional quality), received strategic recommendation to process 50-75 priority files for 85% value at 25% cost ($150-225 vs $650+). Current focus: Implementing automated chunking system for large files in SCRPA_v2_Claude folder, then processing priority files using either automated chunking + AI analysis OR manual comprehensive prompt approach. Key technical assets: C:\Git\police-analytics-tools\kb_builder\ (complete system), heuristic analysis of all 216 files completed, strategic file prioritization completed, chunking automation prompt ready to execute. Ready to: Send chunking prompt to Claude Code, validate approach on sample files, then process 25-75 highest-value files to create professional police analytics knowledge base from 23+ years expertise. Archive scope: 216 files spanning SQL, ArcGIS, Python, DAX, Power BI integration for police crime analysis, spatial analytics, and operational intelligence systems. ```
